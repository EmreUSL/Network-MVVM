# Network-MVVM

- My goal here is to try to create a fresh network layer. 

- I use https://newsapi.org site for network queries.

- I divided the network layer into three parts for the ease of understanding. These are: 
   - NetworkService  -->  Handles API requests.
   - DataRequest     -->  Prototype for sending data into NetworkService.
   - ErrorResponse   -->  Handles general error conditions.
